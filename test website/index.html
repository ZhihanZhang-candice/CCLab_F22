  <p>The search for extraterrestrial life is mainly related to the existence of extraterrestrial life, SETI, and the
    restriction in the solar system. According to the article ”Life Might Be Common In The Universe, But Intelligence Is
    Likely Rare”, There are two “probability methods” to estimate the existence of life in the universe. Compared to
    frequentist probability, Bayesian probability is more reliable. It will form a model to get an assumed outcome and
    analyze how frequently the outcomes are aligns with the observed results to tell you which hypothesis is more
    likely. In the book “Humans in Outer Space” and the article “Life in the Universe: What are the Odds?”, Drake
    equation has been mentioned. It refers to a highly conjectural list of the data needed to determine the likely
    abundance of life-bearing worlds. But most of the terms in the list are still blank. From the reading “SETI, the
    search for extraterrestrial intelligence” we learned that SETI is a collective term for scientific searches for
    intelligent extraterrestrial life. It also points out that UFO is not equal to aliens. In the TED Talk “Beyond the
    singularity: The search for extraterrestrial technologies”, Siemion talked about discriminating common life and
    intelligence by technology. What’s more, based on the reading “The Search for the Life in the Solar System, we learn
    that finding a hospitable condition in the solar system is difficult. Also, it discusses that the difficulties of
    preparing enough energy to get out of the solar system. The above two facts explain why we are physically confined
    to the solar system partly.</p>
